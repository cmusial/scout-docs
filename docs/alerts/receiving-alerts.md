# Receiving Alerts

Learn how to view your received alerts

## Alert Frequency

Alerts are sent based on the frequency you selected when creating your alert:

- **Daily**: Receive updates once per day
- **Weekly**: Get a summary of new matches every week
- **Monthly**: Get a summary of new matches every month

You can adjust the frequency at any time by editing your alert settings.

## Email Notifications

All alert notifications are sent to the email address associated with your Scout account:

1. Make sure your account email is up to date
2. Check your email at the frequency you selected
3. Look for emails from Scout with the subject line "New Business Alert"
